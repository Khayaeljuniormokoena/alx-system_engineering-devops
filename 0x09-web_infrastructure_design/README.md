Project Overview
This project involves designing a web infrastructure that separates components across servers, including a load balancer configured as a cluster using HAproxy.

Infrastructure Design
Components:
User's Device: Devices from which users want to access the website.

www.foobar.com: The domain name that users will use to access the website.

DNS Server: Resolves the domain name (www.foobar.com) to the IP addresses of the load balancers.

Load Balancer (HAproxy Cluster): Distributes incoming traffic among multiple servers for load balancing.

Nginx (Web Server): Handles incoming HTTP requests, serves static content, and acts as a reverse proxy to the application server.

Application Server: Runs the application code and processes dynamic content.

MySQL Database: Stores and manages the data for the web application.

Specifics:
Why adding each element:
Load Balancer (HAproxy Cluster): Introduces redundancy and fault tolerance by creating a cluster of load balancers. If one fails, the other can handle incoming traffic seamlessly.
Split Components Across Servers: Separating web server, application server, and database onto different servers allows for better resource management, scalability, and ease of maintenance.
Explanation of Components
User's Device:

Devices from which users want to access the website.
www.foobar.com:

The domain name that users will use to access the website.
DNS Server:

Resolves the domain name (www.foobar.com) to the IP addresses of the load balancers.
Load Balancer (HAproxy Cluster):

Distributes incoming traffic among multiple servers for load balancing. Configured as a cluster to enhance reliability and availability.
Nginx (Web Server):

Handles incoming HTTP requests, serves static content, and acts as a reverse proxy to the application server.
Application Server:

Runs the application code and processes dynamic content. Separated from the web server for better resource allocation and scalability.
MySQL Database:

Stores and manages the data for the web application. Separated from the application server for improved security and scalability.
Issues with This Infrastructure
Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

The load balancer cluster helps mitigate the risk of a single point of failure, but it's essential to continuously monitor and maintain the cluster for optimal performance.
Scalability:

While this design allows for better scalability by separating components, it's crucial to plan for future growth and potentially introduce additional servers if needed.
Monitoring:

Implement a robust monitoring solution to detect issues early on, ensuring high availability and performance.
By separating components across servers and configuring the load balancer as a cluster, this infrastructure aims to enhance reliability, scalability, and overall system performance.
